# MultiLevelCache

The configuration properties are specified in *application.properties*
- we can configure number of levels, capacities, read time and write times using this file

To run the project, we need to run the *Application class*
The project uses a command line runner for this purpose
The commands supported are:
 - READ key
 - WRITE key value
 - DISPLAY
the command parameters need to be space separated for now
Note: Upsert is not currently supported due to time constraints
